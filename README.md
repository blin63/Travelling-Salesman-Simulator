## Travelling Salesman Simulator

**NOTE: This program was written for a past school assignment
while learning how to code in C++**

This program simulates the shortest possible route a travelling salesman
can take to get to all 32 cities by learning the most optimum
routes over a duration of time.

This program utilizes a genetic algorithm to allow the simulation
to function correctly. In addition, the distances between the 32 cities
are randomized each time the program is run resulting in different
optimum results each time.
